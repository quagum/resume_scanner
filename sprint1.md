# 1.3 Resume and Job Description Input Handling

---

### **Task 8**: Create API Endpoints to Accept Resume Upload (PDF) or Pasted Text with Validation

- **Objective**: Develop API endpoints for uploading resumes (PDFs) or pasting text job descriptions, with data validation for both inputs.

- **Technical Details**:
  1. **Endpoint for Resume Upload**:
     - URL: `POST /api/resume-upload`
     - Expected Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
     - Request:
       - `resume_file`: File field for uploading a PDF or docx.
     - Backend Logic:
       - Check the file type to confirm it’s a PDF (e.g., MIME type `application/pdf`) or docx.
       - Validate the file size (should not exceed 2MB).
       - Temporarily store the file in memory or process it directly (no persistence required).
     - Response:
       - **Success** (`200 OK`):
         ```json
         {
           "message": "Resume uploaded successfully.",
           "status": "success"
         }
         ```
       - **Error** (`400 Bad Request`):
         ```json
         {
           "error": "Invalid file type. Only PDF files are allowed.",
           "status": "error"
         }
         ```
  
  2. **Endpoint for Job Description Text Input**:
     - URL: `POST /api/job-description`
     - Expected Content-Type: `application/json`
     - Request:
       - `job_description`: Text field for the job description (e.g., requirements, qualifications).
       - Validation: Maximum character count is 5,000 characters.
     - Backend Logic:
       - Ensure the text input does not exceed 5,000 characters.
       - Clean the text by removing extraneous whitespace.
     - Response:
       - **Success** (`200 OK`):
         ```json
         {
           "message": "Job description submitted successfully.",
           "status": "success"
         }
         ```
       - **Error** (`400 Bad Request`):
         ```json
         {
           "error": "Job description exceeds character limit.",
           "status": "error"
         }
         ```

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test successful and failed file uploads (valid PDF, invalid file type, and oversized file).
  - Test successful and failed text input submissions (valid length, over 5,000 characters).

       - Display real-time character count.
       - Provide a warning if the character limit is approached or exceeded.

  2. **Form Submission**:
     - Use Axios or Fetch API to submit the form data:
       - Upload the resume to `POST /api/resume-upload`.
       - Submit the job description to `POST /api/job-description`.
     - Display submission success or error messages on the form.

### **Task 11**: Create Utility Functions to Parse and Extract Text from Uploaded Files

- **Objective**: Create utility functions for parsing and extracting text from uploaded PDFs.

- **Technical Details**:
  - **Backend Utility**:
    - Use libraries like PyPDF2 (Python) or pdf-lib (JavaScript) for text extraction.
    - The extracted text should be processed to remove unnecessary line breaks and whitespace.
  - **Example Function in Python**:
    ```python
    from PyPDF2 import PdfReader

    def extract_text_from_pdf(file):
        reader = PdfReader(file)
        text = ""
        for page in reader.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text.strip()
    ```
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test text extraction on sample PDFs with varying structures.
  - Verify extracted text format (e.g., no extraneous whitespace).

---

### **Task 12**: Implement Temporary In-Memory Storage for Uploaded Data

- **Objective**: Store uploaded data temporarily in memory (no persistence to a database).

- **Technical Details**:
  - **Backend**:
    - Use an in-memory data store like Python’s dictionary or cache.
    - Store extracted resume text and job description in memory with session identifiers.
    - Example structure for temporary storage:
      ```python
      temp_storage = {
          "session_id_123": {
              "resume_text": "Extracted resume text here...",
              "job_description": "Submitted job description here..."
          }
      }
      ```
    - Ensure that data is cleared after processing to free memory.
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test data insertion and retrieval in memory.
  - Ensure data is removed once processing is complete.
