# Development Guidelines

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Task-Related Branches
- Each task/ticket should be associated with a branch.
- **Naming Format**: `FEATURE-{featureName}`
- **Example**: `FEATURE-resume-parser`
- Ensure the `featureName` is easily understandable.

### Personal Development Branches
- For personal development and testing, use the following naming format:
- **Naming Format**: `DEV-{yourName}`
- **Example**: `DEV-charles`
- Only commit to personal dev branches if they are yours, unless you have explicit permission.

## Commit Message Guidelines
- Commit messages should be understandable to you.
- No strict rules; just ensure clarity.

## Pull Request (PR) Reviews
- All PRs into `main` require a review by at least **one person**.
- Ensure your code is ready for review before requesting.
